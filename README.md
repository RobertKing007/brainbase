### Get Todos
returns the whole list of the todos

### get Todo
returns the requested todo by id
Required parameter is a valid number 1-100

### Notes
This is a serverless TS/nodejs app with two endpoints. This api goes to a dumby api to get the data,
then send that data back as the response object.

I tried to add everything to AWS and have a testable link (I console logged the responses) but I seemed to run into some issues
I was told to spend 2-3 hours so this is where I got. Code works but AWS isnt configured all the way. I probably spent more time
trying to figure out AWS than writing the code.
